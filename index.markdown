<h4><strong> About me </strong> </h4>

<p align="justify"> I am a first year PhD student in Applied and Computational Mathematics (PACM) at Princeton University. Previously I was a Master's student at Universidad de los Andes under the guidance of <a href="http://wwwprof.uniandes.edu.co/~mvelasco/Velasco.html">Mauricio Velasco</a> on representation theory and geometry applied to polynomial optimization. I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in both Mathematics and Physics at UniAndes. </p>

<p align="justify"> My interests lie in applied algebra and geometry, particularly (and in no prescribed order) in polynomial optimization, combinatorics and thoeretical physics. </p>
