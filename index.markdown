<h4><strong> About me </strong> </h4>

<p align="justify"> I am a second year PhD student in Applied and Computational Mathematics (PACM) at <a href="https://www.pacm.princeton.edu">Princeton University</a>. 

<p align="justify"> My current interests lie in the intersection of algebraic combinatorics, algebraic geometry and convex geometry. I am also interested in computational algebra and applied algebraic geometry (for instance to optimization or physics). </p>
  
<p align="justify"> Previously I was a Mathematics Master's student at <a href="https://matematicas.uniandes.edu.co">Universidad de los Andes</a> under the guidance of <a href="http://wwwprof.uniandes.edu.co/~mvelasco/Velasco.html">Mauricio Velasco</a> using representation theory and algebraic geometry in polynomial optimization. In 2021 I graduated from UniAndes as well, obtaining a bachelor's degree in both Mathematics and Physics. </p>
