<h4><strong> About me </strong> </h4>

<p align="justify"> I am a first year PhD student in Applied and Computational Mathematics (PACM) at <a href="https://www.pacm.princeton.edu">Princeton University</a>. Previously I was a Master's student in Mathematics at <a href="https://matematicas.uniandes.edu.co">Universidad de los Andes</a> under the guidance of <a href="http://wwwprof.uniandes.edu.co/~mvelasco/Velasco.html">Mauricio Velasco</a> on representation theory and geometry applied to polynomial optimization. I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree at UniAndes as well, in both Mathematics and Physics. </p>

<p align="justify"> My interests lie in applied algebra and geometry, particularly (and in no prescribed order) in polynomial optimization, combinatorics and theoretical physics. </p>
