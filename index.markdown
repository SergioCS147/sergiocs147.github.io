I am a second year Master's Student at Universidad de los Andes. Currently I work under the guidance [Mauricio Velasco](http://wwwprof.uniandes.edu.co/~mvelasco/Velasco.html) on applied representation theory and geometry in polynomial optimization.

I am interested in all kinds of applied algebra and geometry, specially to optimization and control theory. I obtained my bachelor’s degree in both Mathematics and Physics at UniAndes. I finished my bachelor's in Mathematics under [David Karpuk](https://sites.google.com/view/davidkarpuk/home) and my thesis concerned lattice group theory with a motivation in coding theory.
