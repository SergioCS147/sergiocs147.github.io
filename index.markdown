<p align="justify"> I am a second year Master's Student at Universidad de los Andes. Currently I work under the guidance <a href="http://wwwprof.uniandes.edu.co/~mvelasco/Velasco.html">Mauricio Velasco</a> on applied representation theory and geometry in polynomial optimization. </p>

<p align="justify"> My interests lie broadly in applied algebra and geometry, lately in applications to optimization and control theory. I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in both Mathematics and Physics at UniAndes. My bachelor's thesis in Mathematics was completed under <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/davidkarpuk/home">David Karpuk</a> and concerned lattice group theory with a motivation in coding theory. </p>
