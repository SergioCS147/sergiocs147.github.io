<h4><strong> About me </strong> </h4>

<p align="justify"> I am a zeroth year PhD student at Princeton in Applied and Computational Mathematics. Previously I was a Master's student at Universidad de los Andes under the guidance of <a href="http://wwwprof.uniandes.edu.co/~mvelasco/Velasco.html">Mauricio Velasco</a> on representation theory and geometry applied to polynomial optimization. </p>

<p align="justify"> My interests broadly lie in applied algebra and geometry. I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in both Mathematics and Physics at UniAndes. My bachelor's thesis in Mathematics was completed under <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/davidkarpuk/home">David Karpuk</a> and concerned lattice group theory with a motivation in coding theory. </p>
